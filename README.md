c8 -- A CHIP-8 Emulator
=======================

The goal of this project is to create another CHIP-8 Emualtor/Interpreter.  I
didn't fully complete the last one.  I first will get the emulator working in
SDL2 and then port it over to Qt, and then add some other features.

Unlike the last one, this is not going to be developed in straight up C.  I will
be developing this in C++ to make my life easier.
